\chapter{Vector}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.2cm]
    \item In general, vectors are special objects that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisfies these two properties can be considered a vector. 
    \hfill \cite{mfml/book/mml/Deisenroth-Faisal-Ong}

    \item By convention $(1, n)$-matrices are called rows and $(m, 1)$-matrices are called row columns. These special matrices are also called row/ column vectors.
