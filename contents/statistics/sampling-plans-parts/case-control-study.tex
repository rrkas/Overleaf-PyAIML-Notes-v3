\section{Case-Control Study (disease-based)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  a simple random sample is taken from the population of units having the outcome and from the population of units without the outcome.
    \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}

    \item this way of sampling relates also directly to stratified sampling with the strata being the group with outcome ($D$) and the group without outcome ($D^c$).
    \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}

    \item In each sample or stratum the exposure of each unit is noted.
    \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}

    \item the probabilities $P (D)$ and $P (D^c)$ are known before sampling and are fixed in the sample.
    \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}

    \item the observed probabilities in the sample are inappropriate as estimates for the same probabilities in the population. 
    \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item we cannot estimate how many units in the population have the outcome.
        \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}

        \item we cannot estimate the joint probabilities $P (D \cap E)$, $P (D \cap Ec)$, $P (D \cap E)$, and $P (D \cap E)$ in the population from the sample.
        \hfill \cite{statistics/book/Statistics-for-Data-Scientists/Maurits-Kaptein}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The problem with case-control studies is that the conditional probabilities $P (D|E)$ and $P (D|E^c)$ cannot be determined either.
