\section{Binomial-Normal}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Probability calculation with the binomial distribution function can be adequately approximated with a normal distribution function when the mean $np$ and the value $n (1 - p)$ are both larger than $5$ and the sample size is at least $20$ ($n \geq 20$).
