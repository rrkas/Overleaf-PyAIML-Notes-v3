\begin{enumerate}
    \item First-choice hill climbing implements stochastic hill climbing by generating successors \textbf{randomly} until one is generated that is better than the current state. 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
    \item This is a good strategy when a state has many (e.g., thousands) of successors.
