\begin{enumerate}
    \item Instead of choosing the best $k$ from the the pool of candidate successors, stochastic beam search chooses $k$ successors at random, with the probability of choosing a given successor being an increasing function of its value. 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
    \item Stochastic beam search bears some resemblance to the process of natural selection, whereby the “successors” (offspring) of a “state” (organism) populate the next generation according to its “value” (fitness).
