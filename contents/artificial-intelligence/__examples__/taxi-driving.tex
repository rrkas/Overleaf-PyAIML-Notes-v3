\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Performance Measure}: Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, maximize profits
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item \textbf{Environment}: Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item \textbf{Actuators}: Steering, accelerator, brake, signal, horn, display
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item \textbf{Sensors}: Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, accelerometer, engine sensors, keyboard
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item an automated taxi cannot see what other drivers are thinking.
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item partially cooperative multiagent environment: avoiding collisions maximizes the performance measure of all agents
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item \textbf{Task Environment}: partially observable, multiagent, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous, and unknown
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{As a table driven reflex agent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item the visual input from a single camera comes in at the rate of roughly $27$ megabytes per second ($30$ frames per second, $640 \times 480$ pixels with $24$-bits of color information). 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
    \item This gives a lookup table with over $10^{250,000,000,000}$ entries for \textbf{an hour}’s driving.
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item \textbf{Not possible} to construct the table
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{As model-based reflex agents}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item the taxi may be driving back home, and it may have a rule telling it to fill up with gas on the way home unless it has at least half a tank. 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
    \item Although “driving back home” may seem to an aspect of the world state, the fact of the taxi’s destination is actually an aspect of the agent’s internal state. 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
    \item If you find this puzzling, consider that the taxi could be in exactly the same place at the same time, but intending to reach a different destination.
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
    
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{As utility-based agents}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{utility measures}: quicker, safer, more reliable, or cheaper 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{As Learning Agent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The performance element consists of whatever collection of knowledge and procedures the taxi has for selecting its driving actions.
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item  after the taxi makes a quick left turn across three lanes of traffic, the critic observes the shocking language used by other drivers.
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    \item From this experience, the learning element is able to formulate a rule saying this was a bad action, and the performance element is modified by installation of the new rule. 
    \hfill \cite{ai/book/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/Russell-Norvig}

    
\end{enumerate}
