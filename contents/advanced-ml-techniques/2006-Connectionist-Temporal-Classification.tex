\begin{enumerate}
    \item Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is an RNN output layer that defines a distribution over all alignments with all output sequences not longer than the input sequence.

    \item  However, as well as precluding tasks, such as text-to-speech, where the output sequence is longer than the input sequence, CTC does not model the interdependencies between the outputs.
