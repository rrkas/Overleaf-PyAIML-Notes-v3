\chapter*{Preface \& Disclaimer}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.3cm]
    \item The minimum level of implementation uses \texttt{NumPy} and Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries, rather than building everything from scratch. Such implementations are commonly found in Python textbooks and instructional resources.

    \item Some algorithms are implemented at a slightly lower level than highly optimized external libraries (e.g., \texttt{PyTorch}, \texttt{TensorFlow}) to help illustrate the underlying mechanics and core ideas more transparently.

    \item All necessary citations have been provided to the best of our knowledge. Any missing references are unintentional and will be promptly addressed upon notification at \href{mailto:rrka79wal@gmail.com}{rrka79wal@gmail.com}.
