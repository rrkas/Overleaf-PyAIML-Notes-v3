\chapter*{Preface \& Disclaimer}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.3cm]
    \item Minimum level of low-level implementation is numpy and built-in libraries instead of implementation from scratch. Such implementations can be found in Python textbooks \& other materials.

    \item Some algorithms are implemented on little lower level than optimized external libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc) to show the intricate workings of those algorithms.

    \item All citations are duly made whenever and wherever needed. Missing citations are regretted and will be corrected on reporting at \href{mailto:rrka79wal@gmail.com}{rrka79wal@gmail.com}.

    
\end{enumerate}
